processSoulClass

start with

1. store the classname
2. store the escaped classname (which we'll need for the rule)
3. split the classname by colons into value, property, and modifiers strings

a. splitClassIntoValuesPropertiesAndModifiers is a function that will take a class in, and return an object with value, property, and a modifiers object.

__a1.start by splitting the classname into two, by the last colon.
The string to the right of the colon is the value, and the string to the left is the 'modproperty, ' a string that may just be a css property, but also may have modifiers attached.

__a2. processModProperty is a function that will look at the modProperty string. If it has no colons, send it to processProperty as it's either a verbatim CSS property or a shorthand like 'px.' If it has colons, split it by its colons; the rightmost string will be the property that we send to processProperty, and the rest of the strings should be stored in a modifiers object in reverse order.
