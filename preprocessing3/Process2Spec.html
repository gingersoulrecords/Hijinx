Lessons learned

We need to have totally different functions for processing values, properties, and modifiers. We canâ€™t use the same
function for all three.

Each class will get fed into this function, and we'll process it from right to left, starting with the value, then the
property, then the modifiers.

We need to be able to handle multiple modifiers, processed in the reverse order they appear in the class, or the order
they appear from the right

-split the Classes and store them as keys in an aviator object

e.g. md:hover:text-align:center

-within each of these class keys,
store the escaped class selector (in this case, '.md\:hover\:text-align\:center' ),
their css value ('center'),
the css property ('text-align'),
and modifiers, in order ('hover', 'md')

-we can use these stored properties to build the processed class string
-in this case, the string would go from being processed from

.text-align\:center{
text-align:center;
}

with the base property and value functions

to

matching the first modifier before the property name to know how to process the property (in this case, just add
':hover' to the selector and place the property and value in the selector's block, making sure to keep the selector
escaped)

.hover\:text-align\:center:hover{
text-align:center;
}

to

matching the second modifier before the property name to know how to process the property (in this case, surround the
selector with a media query and add the property and value to the selector's block, making sure to keep the selector
escaped)

@media(min-width:768px){

.md\:hover\:text-align\:center:hover{
text-align:center;
}

}

We're basically passing a string around like hot potato, and different functions take turns building a starter string
(property and value) and then mutating it with modifier functions.
